## 🔧 Technical White-Label Framework

### **Phase 1: Core Platform Duplication (Week 1-2)**

#### **1.1 Repository Setup**
```bash
# Create white-label template repository
git clone https://github.com/nodeagencyai/lead_gen_os.git client-leadgenos
cd client-leadgenos
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-agency/client-leadgenos.git
```

#### **1.2 Environment Configuration**
Create client-specific environment setup:

```javascript
// config/client-config.js
export const CLIENT_CONFIG = {
  branding: {
    companyName: "CLIENT_COMPANY_NAME",
    productName: "CLIENT_PRODUCT_NAME", 
    logoUrl: "/client-assets/logo.png",
    primaryColor: "#CLIENT_PRIMARY_COLOR",
    secondaryColor: "#CLIENT_SECONDARY_COLOR"
  },
  features: {
    emailCampaigns: true,
    linkedinCampaigns: true,
    apolloIntegration: true,
    customWebhooks: true,
    multiUser: false // Premium feature
  },
  limits: {
    monthlyLeads: 10000,
    campaignsActive: 50,
    teamMembers: 3
  }
}
```

#### **1.3 Database Schema Customization**

**Step 1: Create Client-Specific Supabase Project**
```sql
-- Client-specific table prefixes
CREATE TABLE client_campaigns (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'email' or 'linkedin'
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE client_leads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID NOT NULL,
  source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'apollo', 'linkedin', 'manual'
  full_name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255),
  company VARCHAR(255),
  title VARCHAR(255),
  linkedin_url TEXT,
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  industry VARCHAR(100),
  company_size VARCHAR(50),
  location VARCHAR(255),
  tags JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  niche VARCHAR(100),
  instantly_synced BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  heyreach_synced BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE client_webhooks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id UUID NOT NULL,
  event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  endpoint_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  last_triggered TIMESTAMP,
  total_calls INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add client isolation
CREATE POLICY client_isolation ON client_campaigns
  FOR ALL USING (client_id = auth.jwt() ->> 'client_id');
```

#### **1.4 Branding System Implementation**

**Dynamic Branding Component:**
```typescript
// src/components/ClientBranding.tsx
import { CLIENT_CONFIG } from '../config/client-config';

export const ClientLogo = () => (
  <img 
    src={CLIENT_CONFIG.branding.logoUrl} 
    alt={`${CLIENT_CONFIG.branding.companyName} Logo`}
    className="h-8 w-auto"
  />
);

export const ClientTheme = {
  primary: CLIENT_CONFIG.branding.primaryColor,
  secondary: CLIENT_CONFIG.branding.secondaryColor,
  // Apply throughout the application
};
```

### **Phase 2: Custom Webhook System (Week 3)**

#### **2.1 Client-Specific Webhook Architecture**
```javascript
// api/webhooks/client/[eventType].js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { eventType } = req.query;
  const clientId = req.headers['x-client-id'];
  
  // Validate client webhook configuration
  const webhook = await getClientWebhook(clientId, eventType);
  if (!webhook || !webhook.enabled) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Webhook not configured' });
  }
  
  // Process client-specific event
  const result = await processClientEvent(clientId, eventType, req.body);
  
  // Forward to client's external webhook if configured
  if (webhook.external_url) {
    await forwardToClientWebhook(webhook.external_url, {
      client_id: clientId,
      event_type: eventType,
      data: result,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
  
  res.json({ success: true, processed: true });
}
```

#### **2.2 Lead Processing Pipeline**
```javascript
// services/ClientLeadProcessor.js
export class ClientLeadProcessor {
  constructor(clientId, config) {
    this.clientId = clientId;
    this.config = config;
  }
  
  async processScrapedLead(leadData) {
    // 1. Validate and clean data
    const cleanLead = await this.validateLead(leadData);
    
    // 2. Apply client-specific enrichment rules
    const enrichedLead = await this.enrichLead(cleanLead);
    
    // 3. Store in client database
    const savedLead = await this.saveLead(enrichedLead);
    
    // 4. Trigger client webhooks
    await this.triggerWebhook('lead_scraped', savedLead);
    
    // 5. Apply auto-tagging rules
    await this.applyTaggingRules(savedLead);
    
    return savedLead;
  }
}
```

### **Phase 3: Multi-Tenant Architecture (Week 4)**

#### **3.1 Client Isolation System**
```typescript
// middleware/clientAuth.ts
export const clientAuthMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  const clientId = req.headers['x-client-id'] || req.query.client_id;
  const clientSecret = req.headers['x-client-secret'];
  
  // Validate client credentials
  if (!validateClientAccess(clientId, clientSecret)) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid client credentials' });
  }
  
  req.clientId = clientId;
  next();
};
```
