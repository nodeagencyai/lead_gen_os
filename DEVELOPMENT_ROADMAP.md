## Technical Debt & Immediate Fixes

### Quick Wins (Week 1)
1. [x] Replace all inline styles with Tailwind classes
2. [x] Add proper TypeScript types for all components
3. [x] Implement consistent error handling
4. [x] Add loading states to all async operations

### Architecture Improvements
1. **State Management**: Consider upgrading to Redux Toolkit or Jotai for complex state
2. **Styling**: Migrate to CSS-in-JS (Emotion/Styled Components) or complete Tailwind adoption
3. **Component Structure**: Implement proper component composition patterns
4. **API Layer**: Add React Query/TanStack Query for better data fetching

### Code Quality
1. [ ] Set up ESLint rules for React hooks and TypeScript
2. [ ] Add Prettier for consistent code formatting
3. [ ] Implement Husky for pre-commit hooks
4. [ ] Add conventional commit standards
